- **Context API + useReducer** for state management
- **React Hooks** for component logic

### UI/UX Libraries
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **shadcn/ui** components for consistent UI elements
- **React RND** for drag-and-drop functionality

### PDF Processing
- **PDF.js** (pdfjs-dist) for PDF rendering and manipulation
- **PDF-lib** for PDF generation and modification
- Custom PDF processing services for text extraction and font recognition

### Additional Libraries
- **Canvas API** for PDF rendering
- **FileReader API** for file handling
- **Custom OCR integration** (to be implemented)

## Core Architecture

### State Management
- **Centralized state** using React Context + useReducer pattern
- **Immutable state updates** with proper action dispatching
- **History management** with undo/redo functionality
- **Tool-specific settings** with persistent configurations

### Component Architecture

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. PDF Rendering Performance
**Challenge:** Large PDFs and complex annotations can impact performance
**Solutions:**
- Implement virtual scrolling for multi-page documents
- Use Web Workers for heavy PDF processing
- Optimize canvas rendering with requestAnimationFrame
- Implement lazy loading for non-visible pages

### 2. Font Recognition & Matching
**Challenge:** Accurately detecting and replacing fonts in PDFs
**Solutions:**
- Build comprehensive font database
- Implement fuzzy font matching algorithms
- Provide manual font mapping interface
- Support web font fallbacks

### 3. Cross-Browser Compatibility
**Challenge:** Different browsers handle PDF.js and Canvas differently
**Solutions:**
- Extensive browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Polyfills for missing features
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Fallback mechanisms for unsupported features

### 4. File Size Management
**Challenge:** Large PDF files and memory usage
**Solutions:**
- Implement streaming for large files
- Use compression for saved annotations
- Memory cleanup and garbage collection
- Chunked file processing

## Data Flow Architecture

### State Updates
```
User Interaction → Action Dispatch → Reducer → State Update → Component Re-render
```

### File Processing
```
File Upload → PDF.js Parsing → Canvas Rendering → Tool Interactions → PDF Modification → File Download
```

### Tool System
```
Tool Selection → Settings Panel → User Input → Canvas Interaction → State Update → Visual Feedback
```

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security
- **File Validation** - Verify PDF format before processing
- **Memory Management** - Prevent memory leaks with large files
- **Input Sanitization** - Clean user text inputs
- **XSS Prevention** - Sanitize any user-generated content

### Data Privacy
- **Local Processing** - All PDF processing happens client-side
- **No Server Storage** - Files never leave user's browser
- **Secure Downloads** - Use blob URLs for file downloads
- **Memory Cleanup** - Clear sensitive data from memory

## Performance Targets

### Loading Performance
- PDF load time: < 2 seconds for files up to 10MB
- Initial app load: < 1 second
- Tool switching: < 100ms response time

### Runtime Performance
- Canvas rendering: 60 FPS for smooth interactions
- Memory usage: < 500MB for typical usage
- Tool operations: < 200ms for most actions

### File Size Limits
- Maximum PDF size: 100MB
- Recommended size: < 25MB for optimal performance
- Annotation data: Minimal overhead (< 1MB for complex annotations)
